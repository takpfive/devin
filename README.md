## Japan GenAI Research 2024
We have created a comprehensive analysis of Japan's Generative AI landscape in the `docs/research/genai-japan/data` directory. The research focuses exclusively on 2024 data and includes three main files:

- `market-overview.md`: Current market analysis and future projections
- `company-cases.md`: Industry-wide strategic approaches and success factors
- `industry-trends.md`: Detailed analysis of market transformation and technological trends

All data is sourced from authoritative 2024 reports by JISA and IDC, providing the latest insights into Japan's GenAI adoption and strategic directions.
